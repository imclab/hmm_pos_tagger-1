HMM POS Tagger (tagger.py)
10/23/2012

This program was originally written by Tristan Euan Chong as a project for LING
570 at the University of Washington. Given a corpus of Korean text annotated 
with a modified Treebank tag set, it estimates transition and emission
probability matrices. Using a supplied Viterbi decoder (viterbi.pl) and Python
wrapper (Viterbi.py), it then reads a test file and outputs the best tag 
sequence for each line (viterbi-out.txt). The tagger's output file (output.txt)
contains the tagged output assigned to the test set, with mismatches against
the gold standard noted by asterisks, e.g. "**NNX**". It also contains the 
total number of morphemes evaluated and the accuracy of the tagger. 

Data:
korean-training.txt
korean-testing.txt
korean-testing-tagged.txt

Supplied programs:
viterbi.pl
Viterbi.py

Generated files:
e_prob_matrix.txt - emission probability matrix
t_prob_matrix.txt - transition probability matrix
korean-testing-formatted.txt - test file, formatted for the Viterbi decoder
viterbi-out.txt - output of Viterbi decoder
output.txt - output of tagger, with mismatches and accuracy rating
